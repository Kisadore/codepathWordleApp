# Project 1 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Kiahna Isadore**

**Wordle** is an app where you will be given a secret word to guess and a limited number of chances to do so. With each guess, you'll receive clues that indicate which letters are included in the word and where they're located. You aim to use these clues to guess the secret word before running out of attempts. 

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] App displays a keyboard on the screen

## Notes

The main challenge I faced was during exercise 3, assigning a closure. Going into it I didnt really undersand closures in general, but being able to refer back the the slides from the course really helped.
